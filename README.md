# libft

## My hive (42) school libft project [BONUSES]

This was the first project of ours. Decided to do bonuses because why the hell not & I literally have nothing else to do lol.

During our evaluations I actually managed to permanently delete my tester file, that I worked so hard to build. What happened was that I deleted my evaluatee-repo,
that had the test file in it (didn't copy) when I was done evaluating him. :,(

It passes all testers, besides one little bug on split, that none of us could figure what causes it: run war machine and it aborts in all tests.
Nonetheless all of the functions passed moulinette. Although one evaluator did not pass me on the third bonus function.

- I've included the subject as always.
